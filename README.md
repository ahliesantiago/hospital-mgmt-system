Key functionalities include:
- Patient Management – Register new patients, edit existing details, and maintain medical history summaries.
- Doctor Management – Maintain a list of doctors including specialties, availability, and assigned appointments.
- Appointment Scheduling – Create, view, and manage appointments between doctors and patients.
- Search and Reporting – Search for patients or appointments using criteria such as name, date, or doctor; generate simple reports summarizing appointments or patient load.
